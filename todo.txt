General TODO notes on the IDE rewrite.

DOCUMENTATION
-------------

- must document the assumption that the examples directory goes

  examples/category1/example1/<pde files>
                     example2/<pde files>
                     ...
                     examplen/<pde files>
           category2/example1/
                     ...
                     examplen/
           ...
           categoryn/

  i.e., NO NESTED SUBCATEGORIES! otherwise the Examples submenu of the
  File menu will break (alternative is to os.walk and DTRT, but that's
  more complicated than i have time for right now).

TABS
----

- tabs show you when they have unsaved information
- new tab icon
- don't let tabs close? or do something clever if they _do_ close?

MENU
----

- undo/redo/cut/copy/paste should be grayed out as appropriate
- need to have the app not be "Python" (probably requires building a .app)

TOOLBAR
-------

- mouseover support
- text listing what the button does should appear

RESOURCES
---------

- reference directory needs to get more brains
- the examples directory in our current build has examples you can
  save to.  this is wrong, and should not be true in the builds of the
  new IDE.

MAC
---

- either persist the application after the last frame has been closed,
  or prompt the user if they're sure when destroying the last frame

KEYBINDINGS
-----------

- "quit" keybinding (CMD-Q on OS X e.g.) is wrongly mapped to "close" action

CPPStyledTextCtrl
-----------------

- add brace/paren matching
- need to place the cursor inside of the active page during frame startup
