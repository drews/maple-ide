behaviors to replicate:

STARTUP
-------
- on startup, remembers your last sketch and brings it up

TABS
----

- tabs show you when they have unsaved information
- new tab

MENU
----

- undo/redo should be grayed out as appropriate
- need to have the app not be "Python" (probably requires building a .app)
