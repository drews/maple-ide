<h1>Maple Reference Documentation: i2c</h1>
<div class="warningbox">
<h3>Note</h3>
The i2c interface is currently only available from the 'i2c' branch of libmaple
in our <a href="http://github.com/leaflabs">github repositories</a>.
</div>

i2c is a crude and easy-to-hack serial protocol that requires only two 
wires/channels for communication between many devices. Every message passed
on the bus is between a Master (who initiates the message) and a Slave 
device. Slaves are addressed using 7-bit addresses (up to 127 unique devices);
10-bit addressing is possible but currently unimplented.  Every message 
consists of an arbitrary combination of 8-bit reads and writes as requested by
the Master; higher level functionality, such as reading a particular register
value, is achieved by writing to set the memory location then reading to pull
out the data. 

<p>
Note that the Master/Slave designation is on a message-by-message basis. The
Maple can act as both a Master (messages initiated by user code) and Slave
device (responding to requests via configurable interrupt handlers) at the same
time.

<h2><a name="hardware">Hardware/Circuit Design</a></h2>


<p>
The Maple has two i2c ports. Port 1 (i2c1) has SDA on header D9 and SCL on D5; 
Port 2 (i2c2) has SDA on D30 and SCL on D29.

<p>
The Maple reliably communicates with up to a 400kHz clock speed; this doesn't
translate into a 400kilobit data rate except in extreme cases because of 
addressing and protocol overhead. We have tested clock speeds up to a megahertz
and have had mixed results; in theory it could be possible to achieve even 
higher rates but signal quality degrades rapidly and the bus becomes 
unreliable. 

<p>
Proper wiring and pullup resistor selection are essential when incorporating
i2c into a circuit, especially with datarates above 100kHz. In the lab we 
usually use ~5k ohm resistors with Vcc (3.3v) as the high voltage and try to
connect the pullup voltage as close to the SDA and SCL pins as possible. We
recommend looking at the reference website listed below, starting with a slow
clock rate (10kHz), and if possible using an oscilloscope to debug any issues. 

<h2><a name="functions">Function Reference</a></h2>

<p>
The function API for i2c is not finished! See the source code for now. 

<h2><a name="smbus">SMBus</a></h2>

<p>
The stm32 microcontroller has hardware support for SMBus, we simply have not
writen software for it. The SMBAL line for i2c1 is on header D4 and for i2c2 is
on D31.
