<h2><a name="overview">Overview</a></h2> The biggest difference
between the Maple and most Arduino boards is that the Maple uses a
32-bit ARM Cortex-M3 architecture chip while the Arduinos have 8-bit
Atmel AVR chips. The different instruction set means that machine code
(executable binary programs) is incompatible between the two, and a
different compiler (actually just a different version of gcc) is
required. The compiler for the regular Arduino IDE is the popular
"avr-gcc" package; the compiler for the Maple version of the IDE is
Codesourcery's edition of gcc for the ARM EABI target (aka
"arm-non-eabi-gcc").

<p>
The bitwidth of the processor means that the Maple can process 32-bit
operations (like adding two 32-bit integers) in a single instruction,
while an Arduino processor would have to split up large operations
into several smaller ones. In a lot of cases 8-bit operations are
plenty (integers 0-255, single characters of text, etc.), but if
you're dealing with higher resolution data, the speed up could be
significant. A trade-off is that code could be larger as well; program
instructions and memory locations can be up to 32-bits each, which in
the worst case would quadruple program size. In reality, the removal
of extra instructions and fancy packing together of simple
instructions means that programs aren't much larger (or are even
smaller).


<h2><a name="headers">Header Numbering and Incompatibilities</a></h2>

The numbering of headers is different; on the Maple each GPIO has a
unique number: D0, D1, D2, all the way up to D37 (actually, there are
a couple more...).  On the Arduino, the analog pins are numbered
separately (A0-A5) from the digital pins (D0-D13).

<p>
The incompatible hardware differences are:
<ul>

  <li><b style="color:red;">i2c port:</b> on most Arduinos, the i2c
  port is Analog Input 4 (SDA) and Analog Input 5 (SCL); on the Maple,
  i2c port 1 is D5 (SCL) and D9 (SDA), and i2c port 2 is D29 (SCL) and
  D30 (SDA). It should be possible to skywire, sacrificing signal
  quality (increased capacitance).  Alternatively, i2c can be bit
  banged reasonably well in software. This peripheral could
  potentially be rerouted internally, but we haven't looked into it.

  <li><b style="color:red;">PWM on D10:</b> all the other standard Arduino PWM
  headers have PWM functionality on the Maple (D2,D3,D6,D9,D11), but not D10.
  We did our best! It may be possible to reroute this peripheral internally
  using low level configuration, but we haven't looked in to it.

  <li><b style="color:red;">No External Voltage Reference:</b> The Arduino has
  an Aref pin which allows the use of an external ADC voltage reference; the
  Maple has an extra GPIO pin (14) with PWM capability in this spot, and does
  not allow an external voltage reference to be configured. 

  <li><b style="color:red;">EEPROM:</b> the Maple does not have any internal
  EEPROM. This functionality can be emulated with regular peristent flash
  memory, or with an external EEPROM chip. 

  <li><b style="color:red;">ISP Programming:</b> the Maple does not use an
  ISP/ICSP bus for debugging; it uses JTAG. 

</ul>

<h2><a name="software">Software Language/Library Changes</a></h2>

<ul>
  <li><b>32-bit int:</b> many standard functions either expect or return full
  32-bit (4 byte) integer values instead of the regular 16-bit (2 byte)Arduino
  values.

  <li><b>pinMode types:</b> any GPIO (including analog pins) can be configured
  into one of the following modes with a single call to pinMode: OUTPUT,
  OUTPUT_OPEN_DRAIN, INPUT_FLOATING, INPUT_PULLUP, INPUT_PULLDOWN. Additionally
  the PWM and Analog Input pins can be configured as INPUT_ANALOG and PWM 
  respectively. See <a href="./gpio.html">GPIO docs</a> for more info.

  <li><b>Serial1 syntax:</b> like the Arduino Mega, the Maple has multiple 
  USART ports. By default <code>Serial</code> is not mapped to any of them,
  use <code>Serial1</code> through <code>Serial3</code> instead.

  <li><b><code>tone()</code> unimplemented:</b> On the TODO list!

  <li><b><code>pulseIn()</code> unimplemented:</b> On the TODO list!

  <li><b>16-bit PWM</b>

  <li><b>12-bit ADC</b>

</ul>

<h2><a name="porting">Sketch and Library Porting HOWTO</a></h2>

<ol>
  <li> First check the hardware and header differences above and see if your
  project or shield needs to be modified (eg, add 3.3v level converters or
  reroute PWM to header D10). 

  <li>Check for ported library functionality. We intend to port all of the
  core and popular libraries (like Wire, Ethernet, and the LCD screen driver), 
  but we may not be finished.

  <li>Check for peripheral conflicts; changing the configuration of timers
  and bus speeds for a feature on one header may impact all the features on
  that hardware "port"; for example changing the timer prescaler to do long
  PWM pulses could impact i2c communications on nearby headers.

  <li>Rewrite any low-level code. This could potentially be very difficult, but
  hopefully you've used the Arduino libraries to abstract away the registers
  and other hardware-specific details. Your sketch probably doesn't have any
  low-level code; a library which wraps a particular peripheral very well may.

  <li>Redeclare variable sizes if necessary: generics like <code>int</code>
  will probably work unless you depend on side-effects like rollover. 

  <li>Check every pinMode: the Maple has more modes for GPIO pins. For example,
  make sure to set analog pins to <code>INPUT_ANALOG</code> before reading and
  PWM pins to <code>PWM</code> before writing.

  <li>Modify PWM writes: pinMode must be set to <code>PWM</code>, the frequency
  of the PWM pulse configured, and the duty cycle written with up to 16-bit
  resolution. 

  <li>Modify ADC reads: analogRead takes the full pin number (not 0-5) and
  returns a full 12-bit reading. The ADC pin must be set to
  <code>INPUT_ANALOG</code> using pinMode first.

  <li>Possibly convert all Serial-over-USB communications to use HardwareUsb
  instead of HardwareSerial. The Maple has a dedicated USB port which is not
  connected to the USART TX/RX pins in any way.

  <li>Check timing; Maple clock cycles are just 13.9 nanoseconds, though the
  peripheral bus speeds (which limit GPIO output) are clocked slower.
