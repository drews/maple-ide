<p>
<b><a href="./quickstart.html">Quickstart</a></b>: Installation through blinky
lights, real fast!

<p>
<b><a href="./installation.html">Installation</a></b>: Step by step directions
for each supported platform.

<p>
<b>Hardware Devices:</b>
<ul>
  <li><b><a href="./i2c.html">i2c</a></b> (inter-integrated circuit bus, aka
  two-wire-interface or twi), a simple serial protocol for communications
  between digital devices.

  <li><b><a href="./pwm.html">PWM</a></b> (pulse width modulation) Sometimes
  confusingly refered to as "analog output" even though it's really digital.

  <li><b><a href="./spi.html">SPI</a></b>, the serial peripheral interface, for
  high speed data transfer. Compatible with most SD cards.

  <li><b><a href="./adc.html">ADC</a></b> (analog digital conversion), for 
  reading in analog voltage levels.

  <li><b><a href="./gpio.html">GPIO</a></b> (general purpose input/output), the
  most basic digital on/off signaling on all of the header pins. Multiple modes
  such as pull-up, pull-down, floating, open-drain, etc.

  <li><b><a href="./timers.html">Timers</a></b>, fast and flexible hardware
  counters that can be configured to trigger interrupts at regular intervals.
  They also underlie some of the other peripherals, such as PWM.

  <li><b><a href="./usart.html">USART</a></b> (universal asynchronous
  receiver/transmitter), a generalized version of the classic RS232 serial bus,
  often used for communications with a terminal or personal computer.

  <li><b><a href="./jtag.html">JTAG</a></b>, a powerful special purpose shift
  register bus for debugging digital devices (eg reading out microcontroller
  register states and stepping instruction by instruction). 

  <li><b><a href="./usb.html">USB</a></b> (universal serial bus), the now 
  ubiquitous connector/protocol solution for PC-peripheral communications.
  The Maple is usually programmed via USB and can communicate over it through
  either a serial emulation channel or as a general purpose device.

</ul>

<b><a href="./language.html">Language Documentation</a></b> 

<p>
<b><a href="./compatibility.html">Compatibility</a></b>: A comparison of
hardware and software differences between the Maple and Arduino boards, as well
as advice for porting sketches and libraries.

<p>
<b><a href="./troubleshooting.html">Troubleshooting</a></b>:
For help debuging problems or unexpected behavior 

<p>
<b><a href="./errata.html">Errata</a></b>: A revision-by-revision list of 
hardware changes, errors, and failure modes.

<b><a href="./unix-toolchain.html">Unix Toolchain Quickstart</a></b>: An
alternative to this all-in-one IDE.
