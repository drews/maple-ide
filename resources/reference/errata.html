<h1>Maple Hardware Errata and Failure Modes</h1>
<p>
This page is a collection of known issues and warnings for each revision of
the Maple board. The failure modes aren't design errors, but are easy ways
to break or damage your board permanently. For a list of differences between
the Maple and Arduinos, see the page on <a
href="./compatibility.html">compatibility</a>.

  <li><a href="#rev3">Maple Board rev3</a>
  <li><a href="#rev1">Maple Board rev1</a>
</ul>

<h2><a name="rev3">Maple Board rev3</a></h2>
<p>This batch of boards went on sale in May 2010. They have a darker red
silkscreen and the "infinity-leaf" logo.
<p>Known design errors:
<ul>

  <li><span style="color:orange;">Bad/Sticky Buttons:</span> a number of rev3
  boards sold in May-June 2010 have questionable reset and "BUT" buttons. What
  seems to have happened is that the flux removed we used to clean the boards
  before shipping erroded the plastic internals which results in intermittant
  functionality. All buttons on all shipped boards did function in testing, 
  but some may have worked in testing but be unreliable in regular use. If you
  have this problem we will be happy to ship you new buttons if you think you
  can resolder them yourself, or you can ship us your board and we will swap
  out that part. For reference, the button part number is KMR211GLFS and the
  flux remover we used is "Precision Electronics Cleaner" from RadioShack,
  which is "Safe on most plastics" and contains Dipropylene glycol monomethyl
  ether, hydrotreated heavy naphtha, dipropylene glycol methyl ether acetate
  (really?), and carbon dioxide. 

  <li><span style="color:red;">Resistors on D0, D1: </span> these header pins,
  which are RX/TX on USART2 ("Serial2"), have resistors in-line between the
  STM32 and the headers. These resistors increase the impedance of the lines
  for ADC reads and affect the open drain GPIO functionality of the pins. These
  resistors were accidentally copied over from older Arduino USB designs, where
  they appear to protect the USB-Serial converter from TTL voltage on the
  headers.

  <li><span style="color:yellow;">GPIO 39-43 Unconfigured:</span> this is 
  really more of a software todo item; some of the JTAG header pins are 
  numbered 39-43. These STM32 pins are indeed fully functional GPIO when the
  a JTAG device is not connected, but we have not enabled them in software
  and thus they can not be accessed with the regular <code>pinMode()</code>
  or <code>digitalWrite()</code> functions.

  <li><span style="color:yellow;">Silkscreen Errors:</span> the silkscreen on
  the bottom indicated PWM functionality on pin 25 and listen the external
  header GND pin as number 38 (actually 38 is connected to the BUT button). 
  We manually sharpied over both of these mistakes. 

  <li><span style="color:yellow;">PWM Marketing Mistake:</span> We originally
  sold the Maple advertising 22 channels of 16-bit hardware PWM; actually 
  the Maple only has 15.

</ul>
<p>Potential failure modes:
<ul>
  <li><span style="color:orange;">TTL voltage on non-tolerant pins: </span> 
  not all header pins are 5v compatible; connecting certain serial devices
  in the wrong way could over voltage the pins.
</ul>

<h2><a name="rev1">Maple Board rev1</a></h2>
<p>
This batch of 100 boards shipped in later 2009. They have a red silkscreen and
the logo is a single pixelated leaf.

<p>Issues:
<ul>
  <li><span style="color:red;">ADC noise: </span> generally very high, in
  particular when the USB port is being used for communications (including
  keep-alive pings when connected to a computer).  This issue was resolved in
  rev3 with a 4-layer design and a geometricaly isolated ADC Vref plane.

  <li><span style="color:red;">Resistors on D0, D1: </span> these header pins,
  which are RX/TX on USART2 ("Serial2"), have (TODO) Ohm in-line. These 
  resistors increase the immpedence of the lines for ADC reads and affect the
  open drain GPIO functionality of the pins. These resistors were accidentally
  copied over from older Arduino USB designs, where they appear to protect the
  USB-Serial converter from TTL voltage on the headers.

  <li><span style="color:yellow;">Silkscreen Differences:</span> the pin 
  numbering scheme on rev1 is different from rev3, and thus rev3 software is
  difficult to use. Notably the analog input bank is labeled A0-A4 on rev1 but
  15-20 on rev3, and the extra header bank does not have a pinout table on the
  bottom.

  <li><span style="color:yellow;">No BUT Button:</span> the BUT button, useful
  for serial bootloading, was only added in rev3. As a workaround you can 
  directly short the appropriate MCU pin to Vcc; see 
  <a href="http://forums.leaflabs.com/topic.php?id=32#post-126">this forum
  posting</a>.

  <li><span style="color:yellow;">PWM Marketing Mistake:</span> We originally
  sold the Maple advertising 22 channels of 16-bit hardware PWM; actually 
  the Maple only has 15.
