<h1>Maple Reference Documentation: ADC</h1>
<p>
Analog-Digital Conversion is the process of reading a physical voltage as a
number. The Maple has a large number of pins which are capable of taking
12-bit ADC measurements, which means that voltages from ground to +3.3v are
read as numbers from 0 to 4095; this corresponds to a theoretical 
sensitivity of just under 1 milivolt. In reality, a number of factors
introduce noise and bias into this reading and a number of techniques must
be used to get good precision and accuracy.

<h2><a name="noise">Noise and Bias</a></h2>

<p>
The biggest issues with analog-digital conversion are noise and bias. With the
Maple we have tried to isolate the ADC pins and traces from strong noise 
sources but there are always tradeoffs between noise, additional functionality,
cost, and package size. 

<p>
The 6 ADC pins in a bank (D15-D20) generally have the least noise and should
be used for fine measurements. If the input voltage is relatively slow to 
change, a number of samples can be taken in succession and averaged together,
or the same voltage can even be sampled by multiple ADC pins at the same time. 

<p>
An important factor when taking a voltage reading is the reference voltages
that the sample is being compared against. In the case of the Maple, the
high reference is Vcc and the low reverence is ground: this means that noise
or fluctations on either Vcc or ground will effect the measurement. It also
means that the voltage you are trying to sample must be between ground and
3.3v. In the case of a variable reading, it is best if the voltage varies
over the entire range of 0-3.3v; otherwise only a fraction of the sensitivity
is being leveraged. Resistor dividers and constant voltage diodes are basic
tools which can help bring a given voltage signal into the appropriate range;
opamps and other powered components can also be used. 

<h2><a name="functions">Function Reference</a></h2>

<dl>
  <dt><code>pinMode(pin_num, INPUT_ANALOG)</code>
  <dd>This function is usually called from <code>setup()</code> to configure
  the pin hardware for analog sampling.

  <dt><code>analogRead(pin_num)</code>
  <dd>Returns the voltage read as a number with 4095 corresponding to Vref
  (about 3.3v) and 0 corresponding to ground.
